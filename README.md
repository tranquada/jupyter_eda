# Jupyter EDA (jupyter_eda)
Jupyter EDA is a small set of tools designed to assist with exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas DataFrames. Jupyter EDA's objects wrap around Pandas DataFrames and Series to automate common pre-modeling initial data analysis (IDA) and EDA tasks, helping you to get to the modeling stage quicker. To do this, Jupyter EDA utilizes a variety of industry-standard libraries for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, including:

* Bokeh
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* SciKit-learn
